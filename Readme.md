WordPress Detroit Theme
(I name my themes from places)

The Detroit Theme was based on a website you create from TreeHouse called Best City Guide. You learn how to make that site via the CSS Basics class. I later made the Best City Guide into a WordPress theme during my fifth or sixth attempt to make a properly functioning WordPress theme.

After taking a failed website I made in 2014, turning it into a WordPress theme I called Cambodia, I decided to make Detroit.

Detroit takes the Best City Guide theme TreeHouse made and the Theme I created. I changed some of the colors, added some more items and code to make Detroit.

I'm currently using this theme for http://www.qwick.info
